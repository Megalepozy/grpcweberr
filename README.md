### Package for easy creation & reading of GRPC errors with added data for web clients

Basically its a simple wrapper to the [status](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/status) & [errdetails](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/rpc/errdetails) packages

I made this package public with the hopes that it may help someone but please take into consideration that this package 
is not going to be actively maintained nor can I guarantee any backward compatibility when I make changes, so if you find 
this package useful just fork it :)
